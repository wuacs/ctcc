Category with as object monoids and as morphisms monoid homomorphisms i.e. they need to preserve composition $f: M_1 \rightarrow M_2 \implies f(x \otimes_{M_1} y) = f(x) \otimes_{M_2} f(y)$  and they preserve the unit $f(0_{M_1}) = 0_{M_2}$.

#### Properties
- Their finite products coincide with their finite coproducts making them. Thus making this category have [[Biproducts]], here the proof: [[Exercises ch.2#Exercise 2.1.6]]
