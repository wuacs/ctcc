#### Definition on $\textbf{Sets}\rightarrow \textbf{Sets}$

One way to define the functor is to conceptualize the morphisms as *direct images[^1]*
of the subsets. I.e. $f: A\mapsto B$ becomes $\mathcal{P(f)}(U) = (\amalg_f(U)) =\{x | \exists a \in U s.t. x = f(a)\}$ for any $U \in \mathcal{P}(A)$.

#### Definition on $\textbf{Sets}^\text{op}\rightarrow \textbf{Sets}$ (controvariant Powerset)

Where morphisms are the *inverse images* of the subsets for any $f: A\mapsto B$ we have the function for any $U \subseteq B$ $\mathcal{P}'(f)(U)=\{x | f(x)\in U\}$

[^1]: Direct Image in Mathematics: In set theory and functional analysis, the direct image of a set A under a function f is the set of all elements in the codomain of f that are the result of applying f to an element of A
