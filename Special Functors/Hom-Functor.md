**Hom-Functor** are special functors from a generic category **C** to **Sets** which are parameterized over an object in **C**.

E.g.

$Hom(-, a)$ 
is the [[Controvariant functor]] which maps *every object* **q** in **C** to the set of C-arrows from **q** to **a** in **Sets**.
It maps *every C-arrow* $f: q\mapsto q'$ into the function $H_f$ such that $H_f(g) = g \mapsto g \circ f$
