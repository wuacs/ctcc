#### Definition

An image of an arrow $f: A\mapsto B$ is the "smallest" object $C$ such that:

1. **factorization**: there exists a monomorphism $m: C \mapsto B$ and a morphism $e: A \mapsto C$ such that 
2. **universally smallest**: any other object $k$ which acts as a factorization of $f$ (i.e. $m': k \mapsto B$ and $e': A \mapsto k$) factors uniquely through $C$. i.e. $\exists! y: C \rightarrow k$ such that $m' \circ y = m$ (i.e. i can factorize the image).
